pysocialgraph

This is a very basic python wrapper around Google's social graph API. It will hopefully be improved as I have time, it was written as a basic proof of concept.

It stores data from the social graph locally, so that it doesn't steal all your bandwidth and hit google constantly. 

I will also be releasing a Django version of this code a bit later on.
